# Understanding-the-internals-of-a-neural-net
This is repository focusses on understanding how different activations, initialization of weights and biases , and loss functions affect a neural nets by understanding the internal gradient distribution, weight distribution , saturation of activations using pre activations and last layer logit distribution.
